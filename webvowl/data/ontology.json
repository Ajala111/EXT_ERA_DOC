It represents the concepts and relationships linked to the sectorial legal framework and the use cases under the Agency´s remit, as described in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) [to be updated after publication] on the common specifications for the register of railway infrastructure [to be updated after publication].\n\n\nCurrently, this Ontology covers the European railway infrastructure and the vehicle types authorized to operate over it. It is a semantic/browsable representation of the RINF application guide (1) and ERATV application guide (2) that were built by domain experts in the RINF and ERATV working parties.\n\nThe Ontology also includes the route book concepts described in appendix D2 \"Elements the infrastructure manager has to provide to the railway undertaking for the Route Book\" as presented in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) [to be updated after publication] 2019/773 of 16 May 2019 on the technical specification for interoperability relating to the operation and traffic management subsystem of the rail system within the European Union and [to be updated after publication] and the Appendix D3 [to be updated after publication]."

Geometry values in R2 have points with coordinate values for x and y. Geometry values in R3 have points with coordinate values for x, y and z or for x, y and m. Geometry values in R4 have points with coordinate values for x, y, z and m.\nThe interpretation of the coordinates is subject to the coordinate reference systems associated to the point. All coordinates within a geometry object should be in the same coordinate reference systems. Each coordinate shall be unambiguously associated to a coordinate reference system either directly or through its containing geometry. The z coordinate of a point is typically, but not necessarily, represents altitude or elevation. The m coordinate represents a measurement.\nAll Geometry classes described in this specification are defined so that instances of Geometry are topologically closed, i.e. all represented geometries include their boundary as point sets. This does not affect their representation, and open version of the same classes may be used in other circumstances, such as topological representations.\n    "

This could be at the origin of one element, the end of another, or even at specific offsets along their lengths. For example, two tracks might connect at a junction, with one ending at offset 1500 and the other beginning at offset 0. \nNetRelation explicitly models these connections by linking two linear elements (elementA and elementB) and defining their physical or logical relationship.\nNet relations also specify the permitted directions of travel:\n•\tAB: Trains can move from element A to element B.\n•\tBA: Trains can move from element B to element A.\n•\tBoth: Movement is bidirectional.\n•\tNone: No movement is allowed between the two elements.\nTo make this even more precise, net relations include information about whether the connection is at the origin of each element. For example, a relation might indicate that Track A ends at its origin (offset 0) and connects to Track B at its start (isOnOriginOfElementA and isOnOriginOfElementB).\n",

This assessment shall be completed within a maximum period of 6 months after receiving the railway undertaking's request. The acceptance of reflective plates shall be granted, unless the Member State can duly justify the refusal based on the negative result of the assessment.\nMember States shall in particular endeavour to permit the use of reflective plates on rail freight corridors, with a view to prioritise the current bottlenecks. These sections and details of any conditions pertaining to them shall be recorded in the RINF. Until the information is encoded in RINF, the infrastructure manager shall ensure the information is communicated to railway undertakings by other appropriate means.
