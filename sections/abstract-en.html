<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    An ontology-based data model standardizes semantic interoperability across heterogeneous systems in rail traffic management and infrastructure domains, addressing three core use cases:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(1) Interface specification for infrastructure data provisioning</strong>, which models entities such as tracks, signals, switches, and topological relationships to ensure consistent data exchange between infrastructure databases and Traffic Management Systems (TMS) or Traffic Control and Supervision Systems (TCSS).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(2) Real-time data integration</strong>, formalizing temporal and spatial concepts for dynamic information like train positions, timetable deviations, and infrastructure state updates (e.g., occupancy, faults), with support for event-driven communication.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(3) Central infrastructure registry compliance</strong>, structuring static and operational metadata (e.g., asset ownership, maintenance history, geospatial data) to meet regulatory reporting standards.
</p>
<p>
    The ontology decouples the logical information schema from implementation-specific protocols, enabling mappings to diverse interfaces (JSON, binary streams) while preserving semantic consistency. By formalizing domain entities, relationships, and constraints in a machine-interpretable framework, the model reduces syntactic and structural heterogeneity across stakeholders, facilitating scalable data federation and context-aware integration of rail systems.
